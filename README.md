# Lost Knight Web

This is a visualiser for different path-finding algorithms styled as a chess game.

## It is still in active development

There is a sea of features I'm planning to add and bugs to fix.

### Plans

1. Create better menu
2. Add more algorithms
3. Add different moving patterns
4. Draw icons for pieces.
